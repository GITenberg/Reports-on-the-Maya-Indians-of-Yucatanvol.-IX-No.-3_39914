<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>
<p>So little has been written in
  regard to the ethnology of the
  Maya Indians of Yucatan, and
  especially concerning their beliefs,
  which persist to the present time,
  that we publish here a translation of an
  important and practically unknown account
  of this subject. This report was
  printed in Mexico in 1870, but it is buried
  in a study by Antonio Garc&iacute;a y Cubas
  entitled &quot;Materiales para formar la
  Estadistica General de la Republica
  Mexicana,&quot; in <i>Boletin de la Sociedad
  Mexicana de Geografia y Estadistica</i>,
  segunda epoca, tomo II, pp. 352-388.
  It is on pages 374-387, bears the date
  M&eacute;rida, October 24, 1861, and was
  written by Santiago Mendez, who states
  that he was governor of Yucatan during
  the years 1841-42. In connection with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> study of this report, so far as it relates to
  the beliefs of the Maya, it will be profitable
  to consult the paper by Dr Daniel G.
  Brinton on The Folk-lore of Yucatan,
  printed in the <i>Folk-Lore Journal</i>, London,
  vol. I, part viii, 13 pp., August, 1883.</p>
<p>We have also had translated the notes
  on the superstitions of the Indians of
  Yucatan contained in the work of Pedro
  Sanchez de Aguilar, 1639, published by
  the Museo Nacional of Mexico in 1892
  (pp. 83-84), and the report of Francisco
  Hernandez on the religious beliefs of the
  Yucatan Indians, which was sent to
  Bartolom&eacute; de las Casas, evidently while
  Bishop of Yucatan in 1545, and is given by
  him in chapter cxxiii (pp. 328-330) of
  his Apologetica Historia de las Indias, a
  work which did not appear in print until
  1875-76, the first complete edition of
  which was edited by M. Serrano y Sanz,
  and printed at Madrid in 1909.</p>
<p>The information contained in the
  Mendez report is strikingly similar to
  that given by Bartolom&eacute; Jos&eacute; Granado
  Baeza on Los Indios de Yucatan, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> account written in 1813 but not published
  until 1845, when it appeared in the <i>Registro Yucateco</i>, tomo I, pp. 165-178.
  This report of Baeza is one of the principal
  sources used by Brinton in his study.</p>
<p>The editor has incorporated a few brief
  notes, and has prepared a glossary of the
  Indian words and a short bibliography of
  the subject.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MAYA_INDIANS_OF" id="THE_MAYA_INDIANS_OF">THE MAYA INDIANS OF<br />
  YUCATAN IN 1861</a></h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">By Santiago Mendez</span></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Report on the Customs, Labor, Language,
    Industry, Physiognomy, etc., of the Indians
    of Yucatan, made by the Agent of the
    Department of Public Works, who signs
    this report, in obedience to orders of
    February 6, 1861.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="CUSTOMS" id="CUSTOMS">CUSTOMS</a></h3>
<p>The character of the Indians of
  Yucatan is such that, were
  they to be judged only by
  their customs and their habits,
  we would have to qualify them as stupid
  and devoid of reason. It seems indifferent
  to them to be in the shade or exposed
  to rain or to the scorching rays of the
  sun, even though they could avoid it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> It does not matter to them whether they
  go dressed or naked. They never try to
  obtain commodities they see other races
  enjoy, even though the trouble or sacrifice
  it would cost to get them might be
  but small. In order to rest or to chat
  with their companions they hardly ever
  sit down: they squat, it being quite indifferent
  to them that they do it in a sun
  that scorches them when they might perhaps
  have shade two steps from where
  they are. Reward does not encourage
  them, nor does punishment admonish
  them; in the first place, they think they
  deserve more,&mdash;perhaps because they
  were always accustomed to be made use
  of,&mdash;and in the second case they consider
  punishment as a kind of fatality
  from which it is quite useless to try to
  deliver themselves: hence they do not
  reform. So long as their hunger is stilled,
  it is quite indifferent to them whether
  their meal is exquisite and varied, or
  whether it consists only of tortillas and
  chile, devouring their food in either case
  with astounding voracity. When they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> find themselves driven by utter necessity,
  they will work in order to remedy it,
  but they never do so with zeal or with
  the desire to improve their fortunes.
  They are so improvident that they may
  squander in one day the earnings of a
  week, in an exaggerated amount of dainties
  or in superstitious practices, and
  above all by intoxicating themselves,
  leaving their families without bread and
  clothing. Or, they remain idle until
  whatever they earned by the sweat of
  their brow is gone. They cultivate a
  cornfield and gather a good harvest from
  it, and even though they do not need
  to do so, they will sell the corn with considerable
  loss in order to squander the
  money in splendid repasts and superstitions,
  both of which always go together.
  This harvest might insure the subsistence
  of their family for a whole year, but their
  improvidence will reduce them within a
  few days to having to sell themselves for
  work (peonage).</p>
<p>The love of the parents for their children,
  of the children for their parents, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> between husband and wife, is barely
  lukewarm, and not at all passionate, if
  we are to judge from their absolute lack
  of signs of sympathy, pity, or condolence.
  They contemplate dry-eyed and rather
  indifferently the suffering of their nearest,
  and even their demise, without allowing
  this to change their demeanor or letting
  it interfere in the least with their general
  customs of life.</p>
<p>Although some of them can read and
  write, they use it very little, either because
  they are very slow and clumsy in
  the exercise of both, on account, no
  doubt, of the lack of practice, and also
  because there is but little written in their
  own language.</p>
<p>Their children have usually no other
  education than that which they receive
  from the curates, priests, choirmasters,
  and teachers of the catechism, which education
  was formerly given to them at the
  church doors or in the mansions of the
  large ranches and farms, and they were
  compelled to assemble every morning
  from seven to eight to learn the catechism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> At the present day, as it is not
  possible to force the parents to send their
  children to learn even this, there are but
  few who learn at all, especially among the
  boys. When the writer of this was
  governor of this state in the years 1841
  and 1842, he succeeded in establishing
  primary schools in almost all the villages,
  and although averse to anything that
  looks or sounds like despotism, he authorized,
  nevertheless, the mayors, justices of
  the peace, and chieftains (<i>ca&ccedil;iques</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>) to use
  it in order to force parents to send their
  children to the said schools. Unfortunately,
  in 1842 came the invasion by
  the forces of general Santa Anna, and in
  the effort to resist them, all the resources
  of the state were spent for many years in
  advance. Then followed our own senseless
  revolutions and the almost general
  uprising of these same Indians against the
  other native races, consequently these
  schools passed out of existence without it
  having been possible until this day to
  re&euml;stablish them. Hence this remains an
  unsolved problem and it is difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> calculate the profit they might have
  brought (once the tenacious and persistent
  opposition of the Indians overcome),
  leaving them convinced of the
  advantages it might mean to further their
  knowledge even in the manual labor they
  perform.</p>
<p>Generally they train their children
  from a very early age to help in their
  agricultural labor such as their forefathers
  did before the conquest, or else
  they teach them light manual labor, such
  as weaving little mats or matting in
  general, making small bags, baskets of all
  kinds and sizes, leather bands such as are
  used by the native porters, sacks, hammocks,
  ropes, to prepare henequen from
  agave fiber, to make straw hats, and so
  forth. In some villages they are taught
  to make common pottery, and in places
  near the coast they are shown how to
  extract salt, to fish, and seamanship in
  general. It is very rare that they are
  taught other arts and crafts or trades,
  with the exception perhaps in cities or
  principal towns, where, especially when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> they have been reared and educated in
  the households of white people, they may
  become efficient in the art of quarrying
  stone, though quite primitively, or they
  qualify as masons, shoemakers, tailors,
  muleteers, drivers, and cowboys. They
  also provide the town with firewood,
  charcoal, and fodder.</p>
<p>With regard to their marriage customs,
  there is little else to say except that the
  daughter-in-law goes to live in the house
  of her father-in-law, and the son-in-law
  goes to live with his wife's parents, which
  is at present the most usual way, because
  an episcopal edict had to be issued prohibiting
  the first-mentioned to avoid the
  very frequent abuses committed on the
  bride by her father-in-law and brothers-in-law.
  At a very early age young men
  marry, without repugnance, women who
  are much older, widows, and even girls
  who have children born out of wedlock.
  To remonstrances made by those who
  wish to dissuade them in view of such
  conditions, they will reply, &quot;Why should
  I care? This happened before my time!&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> It is to be supposed that conjugal fidelity
  is not regarded very scrupulously by such
  couples. Their most common diseases
  depend largely on the seasons, and recur
  regularly. During summer and fall,
  when fresh food is abundant, the Indians
  are very immoderate in its use, consequently
  they suffer from diarrhea and
  vomiting. In spring and summer they
  have <i>tabardillo</i>, which is a burning fever,
  and dysentery, both of which are caused
  by too much exposure to the hot sun;
  and in winter obstinate constipation,
  colds, and affections of the throat and
  lungs. Their curative methods consist
  merely of abstinence and of bleeding,
  which they perform with a thorn or a
  fish-bone, and they cool their blood by
  drinking sour <i>pozole</i> or boiled lemonade,
  or else a decoction of a plant called <i>xhantumb&uacute;</i>. They never use emetics nor
  cathartics.</p>
<p>Ordinarily they eat two meals a day,
  one on rising and another in the evening.
  If they go to work in the field, after having
  breakfasted on tortillas and <i>atole</i>, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> take with them a large lump of <i>pozole</i> which they use as a refreshment at noon
  by diluting it in water. At sunset they
  leave work, and, returning home, eat the
  second meal, generally after having taken
  their bath. Their usual food consists of
  boiled vegetables seasoned with salt,
  chile, and sometimes with the juice of
  oranges (the sour orange is used for this)
  or of lemons. On Sundays, if they are
  able to do so, they buy beef or pork;
  these are the only days when they eat
  meat, except when they kill a wild bird
  or a creature of the woods while hunting.
  Such meat they cook by baking it in a
  special way in the earth, or else in <i>pib</i>.
  The very poor among them live all the
  year round on tortillas and chile, and a
  bowlful of <i>pozole</i> or <i>atole</i>. Even the
  wealthiest content themselves with only
  one dish. This does not interfere with
  their being big eaters, nor devouring all
  they can get when it does not cost them
  anything.</p>
<p>Their usual beverage is called <i>pitarrilia</i>,
  consisting of the bark of a plant called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> <i>balch&eacute;</i> which they put in soak in fresh
  water and honey and let it ferment.
  After fermentation it becomes strong
  enough to be intoxicating. They are also
  very fond of liquor, and there are very few
  among them who do not become intoxicated
  occasionally, at least on Sundays.</p>
<p>Experience, and to a certain extent
  tradition, are their only guides for
  telling the different seasons of the year;
  they have not the slightest remembrance
  of their ancient calendar system. They
  are accustomed to hear clocks strike
  where such exist, but otherwise, simply
  from the course of the sun, moon, and
  stars, they are able to regulate the hours
  of the day and night, more or less. They
  also know when an eclipse of the moon
  is approaching, attributing this phenomenon
  to an intention of the sun to
  destroy his satellite, and they therefore
  are prepared to make a fearful racket with
  sticks, <i>mitotes</i>, whistles or horns (<i>fotutos</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>),
  shotguns, and other instruments during
  the eclipse, believing that by so doing
  they can avoid the catastrophe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
<p>They sleep from early evening until
  four o'clock in the morning. Their working
  hours, if it is at all necessary for them
  to go to work, last from sunrise to sunset.
  If they are paid, they walk or travel at
  all hours, even with a load.</p>
<p>There are a few among them who are
  trustworthy and faithful in their contracts,
  and know how to keep their word
  and promises; but there is a greater
  number who absolutely lack all of these
  virtues, with the exception, perhaps, of
  the solemn promises they make to their
  saints, in the fulfilment of which they are
  scrupulously punctual.</p>
<p>They lie easily and very frequently,
  although they are aware that lies are
  prohibited. Generally they evade, whenever
  possible, a truthful answer which is to
  the point and fully satisfies the question.</p>
<p>Their principal vices are lasciviousness
  among both sexes, and drunkenness
  among the men. To do them justice
  though, we might as well acknowledge
  that it is more than probable that if other
  races and tribes had to live as they do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> almost naked, in the complete liberty
  and isolation of country places, all members
  of one family, males and females,
  grownups and minors, the married and
  the single ones sleeping together in those
  little huts without any, or at best, very
  scant, knowledge of religion, of modesty
  and honor, without any fear of the consequences
  of unchastity to the women,
  without any intellectual enjoyment, reduced
  to the merest essentials&mdash;to satisfy
  hunger, thirst, sleep, and the intercourse
  of the two sexes, might they not be guilty
  of worse crimes?</p>
<p>They are generally accused of being
  inclined to theft, but as a rule they steal
  small things of little value, and they are
  not known to recur to violence or murder
  to satisfy this tendency.</p>
<p>The wealthy are free money-lenders to
  members of their own tribe and even to
  those of a different stock, so long as they
  are satisfied they are not going to be
  cheated.</p>
<p>As in almost all of the most populated
  part of the Yucatecan peninsula, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> impossible to use the plow for tilling the
  fields; labor is reduced to clearing the
  tropical growth by burning it in the
  height of summer and sowing corn or
  vegetables when the rains commence,
  to fencing in the fields and weeding them,
  etc. In order to be able to cultivate at
  one time as much as possible of their
  extensive lands, the wealthy Indians pay
  their day-laborers and volunteers exceedingly
  well, either in money or in its
  equivalent in provisions at a price below
  its actual market value, especially in
  times of scarcity. They are guided in
  this by the rule, &quot;This is sweat of my
  brethren and it is not right that they
  should pay it too dearly.&quot; If those
  workers are servants of some large ranch
  and live on the place, they are called <i>Luneros</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> because they give their master
  their day's work on Mondays in exchange
  for the land he gives them to cultivate
  for themselves and for the water he
  allows them for irrigation of their fields.
  If they do not, for one reason or another,
  go to work on that day, he receives one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> real in silver instead. The customary
  amount of work they really are compelled
  to do for their master per year is
  twenty <i>mecates</i> of clearing of untilled
  land and another twenty of already
  previously tilled fields. Had the owner
  to pay for hired labor, this would amount
  to 12 pesos, 4 reals. In addition to this
  they have to give him two hours on
  Saturdays for what they call <i>fagina</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which means work around the house of
  any kind their patron should order them
  to do. On some of the ranches the
  obligatory field-work is reduced to half,
  but in this case they have to pay their
  real for Mondays, and always have to do
  the Saturday's <i>fagina</i>. Any other service
  or work they may be called on to do is
  paid or put to their account. By <i>milpa
  roza</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the first clearing of a field by
  felling trees, cutting and burning undergrowth,
  etc., is meant; while the <i>milpa
  ca&ntilde;a</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> is the clearing of fields that have
  already been tilled the year before, where
  the cornstalks are to be split and burnt
  in order to plant again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>
<p>Those who are employed as cowboys
  on stock-farms receive a fixed wage, and
  are not subject to the Monday service nor
  to the usual field-work. They have to
  look after the cattle and horses, and they
  have charge of the draw-wells, the tanks,
  and drinking pools. They have to
  attend to irrigation, weeding, and sowing
  of the truck gardens and orchards, and
  in general to do all work performed on
  such ranches either for their conservation
  and improvement or else in personal
  service to the owners or for the advantage
  of its products. It is also their duty to
  rasp a certain amount of henequen fiber
  from the agave each day. Their wage is
  from eight to twelve reals per month and
  five <i>almudes</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of corn per week. Yet
  neither this latter nor the salary are
  paid to him as his earnings, but credited
  to his account against what he draws in
  provisions or money, so that he actually
  is always indebted. This, however, is
  the aim of the owners, in order to hold
  the man quite secure, even though they
  know very well that, should the man die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> in their service, they would lose that
  amount. They see to it, however, that
  he never owes too much. This really
  constitutes a kind of slavery (peonage)
  which the men try to avenge by serving
  as poorly as they can, even to such
  masters as aim to make their lot easy
  and agreeable by frequent gifts or
  bonuses.</p>
<p>As a rule the Yucatecan Indians are
  regarded as being meek, humble, and not
  easily stirred to ire and cruelty, basing
  such an opinion on the fact that the most
  customary punishment among them was
  a whipping applied with moderation.
  This kind of punishment did not offend
  them, if they were informed of the reason
  why it was meted out to them, nor did
  they consider it degrading. This characteristic
  is still noticeable among those
  who have remained submissive and
  attached to the white people. It is
  quite different with those among them
  who have had to suffer the cruel, atrocious,
  and protracted martyrdom inflicted
  by the rebels. They are merciless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> to those who have fallen and still fall into
  their power, not only those of other
  tribes, but even of their own, in case they
  refuse to follow their tracks. They have
  no pity on either age or sex.</p>
<p>The chieftains (<i>ca&ccedil;iques</i>) of today, as
  well as those who were in office in the
  past, and the most prominent or wealthy
  Indians, live just as simply as the rest,
  without the slightest variation. They all
  are respected by their subordinates, whom
  they do not oppress to their own advantage,
  nor do they demand any
  services from them without compensation.</p>
<p>The Indians are generally gay, light-hearted,
  gossipy, and fond of tricks, in
  which they can display strength, agility,
  and adroitness. They are also very fond
  of music and song, although not very
  gifted or talented in the execution of the
  former especially. At their feasts and
  dances, which usually are rather tumultuous
  and poorly organized, they still use
  some of the old songs in their own
  language, to the accompaniment of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> little raucous flute, the carapace of a
  turtle (<i>hicotea</i>), upon which they beat the
  time with a hart's horn, and of the <i>mitote</i> or <i>taukul</i>. The <i>mitote</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> is a solid piece of
  wood of cylindrical shape, one yard long
  and a third of a yard or a little more in
  diameter, open at one side almost from
  one end to the other. This opening is
  made for the purpose of hollowing out
  the piece of wood until it is reduced to
  one inch or a little more in thickness.
  On the opposite side of the mouth, or
  opening, they fasten two oblong wings,
  which, starting at both ends, meet in the
  center and are separated from one another
  by a serrated edge. In order to
  play this instrument, they place it,
  mouth downward, on the ground, so
  that the wings remain on the topmost
  side, and they hit them with two short
  sticks whose points are covered with an
  elastic resin that makes them jump, so
  as not to deaden or confound the sound,
  which is of such resonance and force that
  it may be heard at a distance of two
  leagues.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that they
  regard death almost with indifference,
  they are timid and cowardly. They never
  attack the enemy unless they are far
  superior in number. Still, they are very
  astute or cunning to plan ambushes and
  to take advantage of every occasion to
  surprise their foes, and then fight with
  great advantage, always accompanying
  the fighting with frightful shouting.
  They are generally good marksmen, and
  they handle the machete<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> with admirable
  skill. Whenever they see that they cannot
  resist the onslaught, they disperse in
  the woods, but almost instantly come
  together again at a previously designated
  meeting-place. They are very fleet of
  foot and good racers, and of an almost
  incredible endurance for walking long
  distances, even with a load of six to eight
  arrobas [150 to 200 pounds]<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> on their
  backs. They also can stand a long time
  without food or drink.</p>
<p>They do not excel in writing or in
  learning to write, although not a few
  have studied the same length of time and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> the same subjects as white men, but they
  are generally clownish and slow of understanding.
  It happens very often that
  after they have been given a clear and
  oft-repeated order, they will manage to
  execute it the wrong way, and their
  memory is so short that, although they
  attend catechism daily from the age of
  six or seven until they are twelve or fourteen
  years of age, there are very many
  among them who have never been able
  either to learn it or to commit it to
  memory. Those, however, who do not
  evade those lessons and who furthermore
  attend the preaching of the gospel in
  their own language, have obtained Catholic
  ideas about eternity, the last judgment,
  the glory of God, purgatory, and
  hell.</p>
<p>As the climate of the peninsula is so
  hot that it exhausts our physical strength
  and energy, as well as reduces the needs
  of man who can live almost nude and in
  the open air and feed himself sparingly,
  we cannot expect that the Indian should
  be particularly inclined to work. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> had the same experience among the other
  native races, although perhaps their
  social standard may impose greater
  necessities. A hut of six or seven yards
  in length by three or four in width, he
  builds himself; its walls consist of rows
  of sticks (which sometimes are covered
  with a coat of clay) and thatched with
  palm-leaves or grass, with a door frequently
  made of reeds twined together.
  Two or three roughly-woven hammocks
  of henequen, a machete, perchance a hoe,
  perhaps a hatchet, and, very rarely, a
  poor shotgun, are all his furniture. A <i>metate</i> to grind his corn, an earthen pot
  to boil it, another pot to cook the vegetables
  and the <i>atole</i>, a <i>comal</i> or flat
  earthenware plate to cook the corn-cakes
  or tortillas, a pitcher for water,
  one or two <i>jicaras</i> of <i>g&uacute;ero</i>,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> an equal
  number of gourds cut in halves to make
  drinking vessels and for other purposes,
  are the eating utensils. A roughly-made,
  circular stool of half a yard in diameter
  and about as much in height, and which
  is used for shaping the tortillas as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> as for a table at which they eat their
  meals, etc. Fifteen to twenty yards of
  cotton cloth for the man's clothes, for the
  wife's, and for the children's, which
  costs a real per yard, supposing the
  woman does not spin and weave this
  herself; two or three coarse needles, a
  reel of cotton thread, a straw hat, sandals,
  a handkerchief and a cotton belt; a
  large straw basket or hamper, a <i>mecapal</i>,
  and a sack of henequen, complete the
  list. A trough in which to wash clothes
  and to bathe themselves; a few pounds
  of corn which he sows himself, as well as
  chile, beans, calabazas,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> <i>camote</i> [sweet
  potatoes], and <i>jicama</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> a bunch of
  bananas, the leaf of which is used to shape
  the tortillas, and perhaps a sour orange.
  His wood he himself cuts in the forest for
  cooking his meals and also for the fire
  which he keeps all night in the center of
  the hut; and lastly a little salt. This is
  the entire inventory of the necessaries of
  life an Indian family of Yucatan needs,
  and which suffices even to the wealthy
  ones in the larger towns and principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> cities. A great many of them live even
  without some of the things enumerated.
  They substitute for corn and vegetables
  (in case they cannot have them either for
  not having sown or for having lost the
  harvest), fruits, roots, and indigenous
  plants which grow wild all over their
  country, and which are edible and nourishing.
  Shall we still ask why the Yucatecan
  Indian is so indolent, when he has
  such few and such modest necessities, all
  of which are so easy to obtain even in the
  midst of the forests and at a great distance
  from any other human habitation?</p>
<p>He instinctively hates the superiority
  of the white race, and even of the mestizos,
  to whom institutions both of long
  ago and of the present day, customs,
  greater civilization, and above all the
  allotment of land, give so many advantages.
  His almost irresistible inclination
  carries him into isolation, almost
  exile, in order to escape from the torment
  of seeing them and from social duties.
  He retires where the land is free, where
  he can till his field wherever he pleases.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> This accounts for the often very small
  settlements of perhaps only a couple of
  families in the thickets of the forests,
  provided they find a spring or at least a
  watering place, even though they might
  have to travel a considerable distance to
  provide themselves. But even those who
  live in larger settlements, in towns of
  white people, will invariably select the
  most retired spots in streets in the outskirts
  (far away from the center of the
  town) where to build their huts.</p>
<p>This isolation in the big forests is the
  principal cause of his becoming more and
  more brutish, and it grows with the
  facility which those same isolated places
  afford him to satisfy the one and only
  desire he has acquired&mdash;drunkenness.
  It is there he finds <i>balch&eacute;</i> and wild honey
  to brew his <i>pitarrilla</i>. And there are
  ever some of his own race or mestizos who
  bring him liquor in exchange for the little
  corn he may have stored. He gives this
  up with an improvidence which seems
  innate, though perhaps we might attribute
  it to ignorance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>
<p>The Indian never sees the crucifix or a
  simple cross or the image of some saint
  displayed anywhere, without going to
  kneel before it in reverent devotion, nor
  does he ever meet a priest without raising
  his hat or hurrying to his side to kiss his
  hand. He spends half of his earnings in
  devotional offerings which in the end
  degenerate into perfect orgies of religious
  fervor. And yet, in spite of all that, he
  does not feel the slightest scruple to take
  as concubines his sisters or even his own
  daughters.</p>
<p>He does not profess half as much love
  and devotion to God as he shows toward
  the images of Saint Anthony of Padua or
  to the crucifix, both of which are the
  only ornaments he has in his little hut.
  He enters a church without bowing to
  the Holy Sacrament on the main altar,
  but he goes and kneels before the cross or
  before Saint Anthony or Saint Francis
  of Paula, or to any other image to which
  miracles are ascribed, no matter how
  poorly executed or how defective such an
  image might be. On rising from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> prostrate position, he bends over to kiss
  the altar, to touch its board with his
  cheeks or forehead, then touches the
  image itself, if such is possible, at least
  with a twig of some aromatic herb or a
  flower which he carries home as a relic,
  paying it the utmost reverence. In addition
  to this he offers a certain amount of
  money for candles which he lights before
  the image of his saint at certain times;
  he pays for a determinate number of
  &quot;Salve Reginas&quot; to be sung either in the
  church or during street processions for his
  sake, and he offers prayers for the souls
  of departed relatives.</p>
<p>He believes that the souls of the departed
  return to earth, and he therefore
  marks with chalk the road from the
  cemetery to their former abode, that
  they may not get lost.</p>
<p>He has just as deep-rooted a belief in
  witches and elves, and he is in very great
  fear of witchcraft. It is impossible to eradicate
  from his mind the idea that there
  are men who especially dedicate themselves
  to inflict this dreadful art on others.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<p>He fears and respects at the same time
  an ideal being whom he calls <i>Bal&aacute;m</i> and
  who, so he says, is the lord of the fields.
  They all are therefore convinced that
  these fields cannot be tilled without
  danger even to their lives if they do not
  offer him sacrifices before beginning work,
  such as <i>horchata de maiz</i> (orgeat), which
  they call <i>sac&aacute;</i>; a stew made of corn and
  turkey, which they call <i>kool</i>; the tortilla
  with beans, called <i>bulihuah</i>; pitarrilla,
  and fumes of copal which they use instead
  of incense. It may safely be stated,
  therefore, that they adore him like God,
  but they are always careful that the
  white people do not see or notice this
  sacrificial offering for fear of being considered
  as idolators.</p>
<p><i>Alux</i> they call certain apparitions
  which they believe to exist in the ancient
  ruins and on the hills, and they say that
  as soon as it grows dark in the evening
  these apparitions or ghosts commence to
  walk around the houses, throwing stones,
  whistling to the dogs and lashing them
  when they get near them, which leaves the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> poor beasts with a cough that kills them.
  They pretend that these ghosts can run
  with great speed, as well backward as
  forward; that they do not terrify those
  who look at them. They are wont to
  enter into the houses to annoy and tease
  people who are abed in their hammocks,
  not letting them sleep. They assure us
  that on ranches where sugar-cane is
  grown, and just as soon as the grinding
  machine for the cane is set up, they will
  go and turn it or they will drive on the
  horse attached to it, to make it trot
  around. They say these apparitions are
  of the size of a little Indian boy of four
  or five, and that they appear naked,
  with only a little hat on their heads.
  This belief is the cause of incalculable
  loss to antiquarians on account of the
  almost daily destruction of articles found
  in the ruins. The Indians will destroy
  without pity or regard, notwithstanding
  they may be offered a good price for them,
  all the images in clay and other objects
  found on the hills or in subterranean
  passages, because they are convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> that these objects are the ones that become
  alive at night and come out to walk
  around. They attribute to the <i>alux</i> or
  to their influence, all the diseases they
  have, as they consider their touch malignant.
  They say that if these apparitions
  find anyone asleep they will pass their
  hands over his face so lightly that the
  sleeper does not even feel it, but this
  causes him a fever which incapacitates
  him for a long time.</p>
<p>They also believe in the existence of
  the <i>Xtabay</i>, the <i>Huahuapach</i>, and the <i>Xbolontharoch bokolhahoch</i>. The first of
  these apparitions or ghosts may be seen,
  according to them, in the most isolated
  spots of a village or settlement in the
  shape of a woman dressed as a mestizo,
  combing her beautiful hair with the fruit
  of a plant they call <i>xach&eacute; xtabay</i>. She
  runs away as soon as anyone approaches.
  She quickens or retards her flight, either
  disappearing or allowing the one who
  pursues her to reach her side. This
  latter is the case if the one who pursues
  her is some amorous fellow who thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> her to be a beautiful maiden. But as soon
  as he reaches and embraces her, he finds
  that he holds in his arms a bundle filled
  with thorns, with legs as thin as those of a
  turkey, and this gives him such a terrible
  shock that he has fainting spells and high
  delirious fevers. The <i>Huahuapach</i> is a
  giant who may be seen at midnight in
  certain streets, and he is so tall that an
  ordinary man barely reaches to his knees.
  He amuses himself by blocking the
  traffic, opening his limbs and placing
  one foot on either side of the street.
  Should anyone inadvertently try to pass
  between his feet, he quickly brings his
  legs together and so closely presses the
  throat of the poor victim that he finally
  chokes him. The two other specters or
  ghosts confine themselves to repeating
  during the night the noises that have been
  prevalent in the daytime, and especially
  the noise made by the spindle-wheel the
  women use. The other one makes a
  subterranean noise which sounds like the
  chocolate-churner, but both these noises
  terrorize those who hear them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<p>There is no end of superstitions among
  the general mass of the Indians, and the
  most customary form of fortune-telling
  is performed by means of a piece of a
  certain crystal which they call <i>zaztun</i>,
  which means a clear and transparent
  stone, and this enables them to see hidden
  things and also to divine the cause of
  maladies. Those who arrogate to themselves
  the title of a diviner are freely
  consulted, and they receive presents and
  live a very easy and carefree life. By
  means of their tricks and great cunning
  they make the simple and ignorant
  Indians believe, when they are ill and go
  to consult them, that through the <i>zaztun</i> they (the sorcerers) have discovered that
  some ill-intentioned enemy has bewitched
  them, and that in order to discover the
  malicious spell, they will have to wake
  for three nights with an abundant provision
  of pitarrilla, and aguardiente, food,
  and lighted candles. Of course, during
  these three nights they give themselves
  up to high living and immoderate drinking.
  While the others, their patients if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> we may so call them, are sleeping, or
  off their guard, they bury within the
  house or in its immediate vicinity a little
  wax figure pierced by a thorn through
  that part of the body where the complaint
  of their patient lies. When everybody is
  awake after the last night of vigil, they
  start certain ceremonies with the <i>zaztun</i>,
  and finally they go to the spot where they
  had buried the figure and take it out
  within sight of everyone, making them
  believe that that was the witchery.
  Then they start their treatment of the
  patient with the first and any herbs they
  can find, and if by mere chance these
  cure the ailment, they have naturally
  made for themselves a great reputation
  among the ignorant.</p>
<p>They also perform a &quot;healing&quot; incantation
  by offering certain prayers in
  which they mention the diseases and the
  different winds to the influence of which
  they attribute them. They will repeat
  the Lord's prayer over their patient, the
  Ave Maria, and the Creed, and sometimes
  also the prayer to Saint Anthony which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> is included in the Mexican prayer-book.
  On other occasions they will resort to the <i>kex</i>, which means exchange, and consists
  in hanging around the house of their
  patient certain food and drink for the <i>Yuncimil</i>, or Lord of Death, and they believe
  that by so doing they are able to
  save, for the time being, the life of the
  patient by barter.</p>
<p>To prevent bees from abandoning the
  hives and to make them bring home
  ample honey, and also that their owners
  may be free from sickness, they will
  hang in the beehives chocolate cups with <i>sac&aacute;</i> or <i>horchata</i> of corn.</p>
<p>They also perform the <i>misa milpera</i> (mass on the cornfield), which they call <i>tich</i>, which means offering or sacrifice, and
  which is celebrated in the following
  manner: On a barbecue or roast made
  with little sticks of equal length they
  place a turkey, and the one who officiates
  as priest opens the bird's beak and
  pours pitarrilla down its throat. Then
  they kill it, and the assistants carry it
  off to season it. In the meantime they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> have been cooking in the earth some large
  loaves of corn-bread which they call <i>canlahuntaz</i>, which is made of fourteen
  tortillas or broken bread filled with
  beans. When all is well flavored and
  cooked, they place it on the barbecue
  with several cups filled with pitarrilla.
  Now again the one acting the part of
  priest begins to incense it with copal, invoking
  the Holy Trinity; he repeats the
  Creed, and, taking some pitarrilla with a
  holy-water sprinkler, he flings it to the
  four winds, invoking the four <i>Pahahtunes</i>,
  lords or custodians of rain. He then
  returns to the table, and, raising one of
  the jicaras aloft while those surrounding
  him kneel, he places the jicara to each
  one's mouth for a sip. The feast then
  proceeds and terminates by general eating
  and drinking, most of all by the one
  who &quot;officiated,&quot; who furthermore takes
  home with him a goodly supply. They
  say that the red <i>Pahahtun</i>, who is seated
  in the east, is Saint Dominick (<i>Santo
  Domingo</i>); the white one in the north is
  Saint Gabriel; the black one in the west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> is Saint James; the yellow <i>Pahahtun</i>, said
  to be female and called by them <i>Xanleox</i>,
  is seated in the south, and is Mary
  Magdalen.</p>
<p>They very readily take their new-born
  babies to the baptismal font, and they
  never refuse to bury their dead in the
  cemetery.</p>
<h3><a name="WOMEN" id="WOMEN">WOMEN</a></h3>
<p>It is quite astounding how in this
  climate woman in general passes very
  rapidly from childhood into womanhood,
  but this development is still more remarkable
  in the case of the native Indian
  woman, prompted no doubt by their
  mode of life and native customs. It is
  quite usual to see a little Indian girl of
  three trot daily to the woods with her
  parents to help cultivate the fields; very
  often her excursions extend to neighboring
  villages, and she seems to make those
  trips of four and even six leagues with
  the greatest ease, on foot; and after she
  has reached five or six years, she even
  carries her little bundle tied on her back.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>
<p>They also journey day after day out
  into the fields in search of firewood, small
  sticks perhaps not thicker than an inch
  or a little more, which they call <i>moloch</i>.
  They search for the wood themselves;
  they cut it and tie it with two reed or
  rattan rings, so that they can carry it
  on their backs. Then they go for water
  in the morning and again in the evening,
  having to draw it from wells forty and
  sixty yards deep, in buckets made of
  tree-bark. After they have reached the
  age of eleven or twelve years, they always
  present themselves for this particular
  errand, as clean as possible. They take
  great care to be well-washed and their
  hair carefully combed, almost as if they
  were going for a pleasure walk or to some
  meeting. This is particularly the case on
  the ranches and farms, and in almost all
  the villages where they have to provide
  themselves with water from the communal
  wells.</p>
<p>Between the ages of six and eleven
  years the little Indian maiden attends,
  either at the church door or, on big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> haciendas, in the main building, to the
  teaching of our Christian religion. She
  goes there with bare head and with her
  hair hanging loose over her shoulders.</p>
<p>All a mother teaches her daughters is
  how to cook, grind the corn, and shape
  the tortillas; to make <i>atole</i> and <i>pozole</i>;
  to wash clothes,&mdash;and this very poorly,&mdash;at
  all events. Or rather the girls learn
  all those things by themselves through
  mere observation and by helping their
  mothers in their daily tasks. Some
  mothers, however, will teach them to
  spin and weave their rough cotton cloth,
  to sew their garments, and sometimes
  even to embroider in a very primitive
  way.</p>
<p>They are usually accompanied by a <i>criada</i>, or housemaid, who is a kind of
  guardian angel and remains by their side
  wherever they go. When they meet the
  man they love, they bow their heads and
  look down; when speaking of their love,
  with the big toe of one foot they will
  draw lines on the ground.</p>
<p>While they are within their homes they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> wear only a skirt or petticoat of white
  cotton cloth, which covers them from the
  waist down to their knees, and in this
  way they will also present themselves to
  visitors, unless it is someone absolutely
  unknown to them, in which case they
  cross their arms over their breasts to hide
  them from the stranger. If one meets
  them in the fields or lies in wait for them
  over the walls of unmortared stones,
  they hide immediately, apparently to
  run away from the presence of a wayfarer,
  notwithstanding they are all exceedingly
  curious, and the love of gossip
  is one of their main characteristics.
  They are tender-hearted and desirous of
  pleasing, but rather in an uncouth
  manner, in keeping with what little education
  they have received. Anyone who
  asks them something in the name of God
  is welcome to their compassion and to
  whatever they can afford to give.</p>
<p>Their bodily cleanliness almost borders
  on superstition, for they consider a
  person who does not wash her body everyday
  as not quite sane or reasonable. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> their daily bath they heat a stone they
  call <i>sintun</i> in the fire, and when it is well
  heated they throw it into the water they
  have prepared for their bath.</p>
<p>It is very seldom that they are happy
  in their love affairs, because it is generally
  their parents who choose their
  husbands. After the choice is once made,
  the parents of the prospective husband
  come to ask for the girl's hand, and if
  accepted they present an offering of two
  pesetas, which is known under the name
  of <i>pochat tancab</i> or <i>buhul</i>. One peseta
  is for the bride-to-be, the other for her
  mother. From the day following this
  ceremony the bridegroom-elect has to
  furnish daily a fagot of firewood to the
  house of his future parents-in-law. On
  her wedding day the bride is dressed in a <i>hipil</i> or loose garment over a petticoat
  or skirt, the border of which is adorned
  with ribbons of deep purple; while
  another wide ribbon of the same shade is
  tied around her hair. Her head is covered
  with a cloth of white muslin. She
  also has to wear shoes, a rosary around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> her neck, earrings and finger-rings with
  big cheap stones. All this jewelry may
  be borrowed from someone. Once the
  religious ceremonies over, they all proceed
  to the banquet, at which the newly
  married couple and their godfathers
  (sponsors) are assigned a prominent place.
  If the girl is not to continue living with
  her parents, she returns there, nevertheless,
  and remains for eight days, after
  which time the godparents come to get
  her and turn her over to her husband.</p>
<p>The husband is the recipient of all the
  attention and care of his wife. She sews,
  she washes, and she grinds the corn and
  makes the tortillas, the <i>pozole</i>, the <i>atole</i>,
  and all the rest of his food with her own
  hands. She does all the work of her
  household; she has to prepare his bath
  when he comes home from work in the
  evening. These are her daily duties.
  In the evening, by the light of the home
  fire or in the pale light of a tropical
  moon, she sews or mends his clothes and
  hers and those of her children. Whenever
  the husband leaves home to go on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> journey to some neighboring town or
  hacienda, the wife has to follow him;
  she is never allowed, however, to walk by
  his side, but behind, in his footsteps so to
  speak. If this husband gets drunk,
  which occurs rather frequently, and he
  should fall by the roadside, it is the wife's
  duty to remain by his side and take care
  of him until he is able to continue on his
  way. Neither the scorching sun, nor
  heavy rains, nor thunderstorms, nor any
  other danger of the road has power
  enough to take her away from his side.</p>
<p>Even the fact that a woman has just
  been delivered of a child does not serve
  as an impediment to her going with the
  husband; she simply carries the new-born
  baby with her, either in a piece of cloth
  on her back or else mounted on one of
  her hips.</p>
<p>If the husband, for one reason or
  another, is called before a court of justice,
  he appears accompanied by his wife,
  simply because it is her duty to go with
  him and to act as his defender. She
  does this wonderfully well; she speaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> with such warmth and so fluently, with
  such courage and enthusiasm, absolutely
  free from her usual bashful shyness, that
  one cannot help but admire her. And
  this absolute devotion on her part to
  the service of her consort does not weaken
  even with the ill-treatment she receives
  at his hands in return, for whenever he
  is intoxicated he treats her to a liberal
  whipping&mdash;he beats her with his bare
  hands even, or with a stick.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances marital fidelity
  on the part of the women is not,
  nor can it be, very deep-rooted, and
  frequently her seducers triumph over her
  virtue. However, if the husband surprises
  them and the woman succeeds in
  escaping him, he denounces her to the
  next court of justice and demands that
  she be given a certain number of blows.
  She invariably receives them quite resignedly,
  and after the ordeal returns
  peacefully to her domestic duties. If the
  woman is the offended one, she also goes
  before the judge and demands that her
  rival be treated to the same punishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> Any sickness that might befall them after
  this misadventure, they unfailingly attribute
  to witchcraft instigated by their
  offenders. Witchcraft enjoys such wide
  popularity among Indian women that
  there is hardly one among them who
  cannot relate one and even many cases
  of the black art in her family. To their
  minds superstition and credulity go hand
  in hand, and if one tells them of some
  strange occurrence ascribed to enchantment,
  they believe it as readily and as
  firmly as if it had happened to themselves
  or as if they had witnessed it.
  And if one immediately afterward asks
  them whether it is day or night, they
  will answer doubtfully, even after having
  looked at the sun&mdash;so wrapped up in the
  tale have they become.</p>
<p>They are very fond of dancing and of
  music, but they do not perform the
  former either gracefully or freely, nor
  have they any variety or art in its execution.
  They have no talent or gift for
  playing an instrument either. They are
  wont to sing in their idle moments or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> even while at work, but sadly and in a
  monotone.</p>
<p>The woman who finds herself pregnant
  works until the very last moment before
  the child is born, and resumes her tasks
  immediately afterward, as soon as the
  baby is attended to. They leave their
  children so much to themselves, and give
  them so little care, that they are forever
  creeping around on the floor in all the
  mire and dirt, and always completely
  naked. A diaper and a tiny <i>hipil</i> are all
  they get for the first few days of their
  life. Around wrists and ankles they
  occasionally will tie tiny cords made of
  blue cotton to protect them, so they say,
  from epilepsy. Those who can afford to
  do so will hang a little rosary of beads
  interspersed with wooden honey-berries
  around their necks and put tiny earrings
  in their ears.</p>
<p>A pregnant Indian woman will not go
  outdoors during an eclipse, in order to
  avoid her child being born with spots or
  ugly birthmarks on its body; nor do they
  visit women who have just given birth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> a child, because it is their belief that the
  babies would become ill with pains in
  their bowels.</p>
<p>As soon as the child is six months old
  they name a godfather and a godmother
  for the ceremony of opening the baby's
  limbs for the first time. To this end
  they set a table with some kind of
  pottage, and the godfather makes nine
  rounds of the table, with the baby placed
  astride one of his hips, which is the way
  in which it will be carried thereafter by its
  mother. Then they place in the child's
  hands, if it is a girl, a needle, a spindle,
  and the implements with which they
  weave their cloth; if it is a boy, he is
  given a hatchet, a machete, and other
  implements he is expected to use when
  grown up. These godparents enjoy the
  same distinction as those at the christening.</p>
<p>The women do not care about knowing
  their own age, and they keep track of the
  age of their children only until they have
  attained about six or eight years; after
  that they forget it. Although they grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> into young manhood or womanhood very
  quickly, really old age comes late, except
  in the appearance of the women, who at
  the age of thirty-five look like women of
  forty-five.</p>
<p>Their most common diseases are pleurisy,
  intermittent fevers, and jaundice,
  while fits, fainting spells, and hysterics
  are exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>As a rule the women are abstemious,
  economical, and very hospitable. They
  love work, and are fond of raising
  chickens and turkeys, which they sell in
  order to enable them to buy what they
  most need, or else they prepare such fowl
  for banquets, marriages, christenings, the
  day of All Souls, or for the novenas which
  they celebrate for the Holy Cross or the
  saint of their special devotion. They do
  not fancy all manner of necessities, nor
  do they pretend to live on the work of
  their husbands; rather they work constantly
  in order to dominate them, and in
  this they succeed generally, at least to a
  certain degree. They will upbraid them
  if they undertake anything without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> asking their advice. They do not forget
  offenses they may have received until
  they are avenged. In their old age they
  are liable to commit small insignificant
  thefts, and they especially seem to like
  to become mendicants, even though they
  do not need to be. They seem to do
  this as a kind of compensation for what
  in their earlier days they may have given
  to the poor.</p>
<p>Sentiments of gratitude do not last
  long. However, we must in this case
  always except those who were reared in
  the homes of white people. With few
  exceptions (when perhaps poor methods
  or little care in their education, or perchance
  bad example and ill-treatment
  dominated), these Indian girls are virtuous,
  assiduous, disinterested, and very
  well-disposed toward all the different
  branches of service and ready to learn
  whatever they are taught. They are
  modest, and are fond of dressing themselves
  nicely and decently. They are so
  affectionate, true, and grateful, that
  many a time they grow old in the service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> of one family, and if this family meets
  with misfortune and perhaps becomes
  impoverished, they will go to work outside
  to help support them, of which I
  could mention many cases. Just the
  opposite happens with the men, who, although
  they were educated in a white
  family from early childhood, and many a
  time with the same care as the white
  children, the cases are rare that they do
  not gradually drift apart, become estranged,
  give themselves up to vice, and
  finally forget their benefactors entirely.</p>
<h3><a name="DRESS" id="DRESS">DRESS</a></h3>
<p>The ordinary costume of the men consists
  of a shirt of white cotton like ours,
  worn outside the white drawers of the
  same material, which are wide and reach
  to the calf of the leg; a belt, white or in
  colors, is worn around the waist under
  the shirt; a kerchief; a straw hat, and
  sandals consisting of only soles which are
  adjusted to the foot by cords of agave
  fiber, complete his costume. While at
  work in the field they take all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> clothes off and wear only a loin-cloth,
  which they call <i>huit</i>, consisting of a piece
  of cotton cloth fastened around the hips,
  the points passing between the thighs to
  be fastened to the belt below the navel.
  From this belt hangs the sheathed
  machete on the left side.</p>
<p>When they go out, the Indian women
  wear on their heads either a piece of
  cotton cloth of about half a yard in
  width by two and a half yards in length,
  the ends of which hang down the back,
  or else they tie a red kerchief around the
  head, a very bright red being their favorite
  color. A <i>hipil</i> of cotton is fashioned
  like a wide sacque-coat, with an opening
  in the center to put the head through,
  fitting around the neck, having openings
  on the two sides for the arms. This <i>hipil</i> reaches to about the calf of the leg,
  falling on a skirt or petticoat, also of
  white cotton, three or four fingers longer.
  It is fastened around the waist under the <i>hipil</i>, which falls loosely over it. The
  hem of both the skirt and the <i>hipil</i> are
  very often roughly embroidered in blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> or red thread.  For traveling they wear
  sandals like the men.</p>
<h3><a name="LANGUAGE" id="LANGUAGE">LANGUAGE</a></h3>
<p>The Indians of Yucatan speak the
  Maya language, though somewhat adulterated
  through contact with Spanish.
  Several Spanish expressions have gradually
  crept into their idiom, especially in
  cities and principal towns where the
  Indians are in almost constant intercourse
  with whites and mestizos. Many among
  them can speak Spanish perfectly well,
  but as a rule they avoid it, and will
  answer in Maya to those who speak
  Spanish to them.</p>
<h3><a name="STATURE__PHYSIOGNOMY__COLOR" id="STATURE__PHYSIOGNOMY__COLOR">STATURE, PHYSIOGNOMY, COLOR</a></h3>
<p>Generally speaking, the Indians of
  Yucatan are of about the same stature as
  all intertropical races, of a round face,
  straight black hair, rather coarse, not
  very pronounced eyebrows, very little
  beard or none at all, a low narrow forehead,
  black and expressive eyes, a somewhat
  flat nose, small but outstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> ears, protruding cheekbones, a regular
  mouth with thin lips and beautiful teeth,
  a stout neck, broad chest and shoulders,
  arms, thighs, and limbs of robust and
  muscular build. Their hands and feet are
  small, and the toes of their feet stand
  closer together than the heels. They have
  no hair on their bodies except on the head.
  Their color is a copper-brown, darkened
  through constant exposure to the sun,
  especially as they go about almost totally
  naked. The color of the women is
  therefore much lighter, and this is also
  the case with such men as have been
  reared from childhood in homes of the
  white people. Among the women there
  are some very pretty ones, slender in form,
  with an airy but graceful carriage, and
  a very sweet voice; but the hard work
  to which they are subjected from early
  childhood causes them to lose their
  beauty at an early age. There are also
  some truly fine types among the men.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="SAVAGE_TRIBES" id="SAVAGE_TRIBES">SAVAGE TRIBES</a></h3>
<p>Of real savage tribes there are none in
  Yucatan. After the greater part of the
  peninsula, cities as well as villages, had
  been reconquered from the possession of
  the Indians who had taken them during
  their insurrection in 1847, which was
  general, the most tenacious and unruly
  ones among them settled in the eastern
  part of the peninsula, where they have
  built several towns, the principal one
  being Chan-Santacruz. From these fastnessess
  they frequently sally forth to
  attack and even to raze our absolutely
  defenseless villages. These attacks cause
  frightful suffering not only to members of
  other tribes and races, without regard to
  sex or age, but they are at times even
  greater among those of their own race,
  who at one time or another have either
  absolutely refused to join their ranks, or,
  after following their lead for some time,
  have deserted, and returned to live in
  peace among the white people.</p>
<p>Another and by far the most numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span> band of those rebellious Indians went to
  settle in the south of the peninsula, and
  by virtue of the treaty they celebrated
  with General Vega have given up all
  hostilities, although they remain in complete
  independence of national as well as
  of state authorities, and in peaceful
  business intercourse with this city (M&eacute;rida),
  and also with Campeche and other
  points in close proximity to their abodes.
  Colonel Juan Sanchez Navarro drew a
  map, which he presented, together with
  his report, before the government of
  Yucatan on April 12 of the present year,
  on which map he gives an approximate
  idea of the localities on the peninsula
  still occupied by rebellious Indians who
  maintain a hostile attitude and those
  who have agreed to peaceful intercourse.
  The first mentioned he calls the eastern
  group, and the last named the southern
  one.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap"><a name="Note_by_Antonio_Garcia_y_Cubas" id="Note_by_Antonio_Garcia_y_Cubas">Note by Antonio Garc&iacute;a y Cubas</a></span></h2>
<p>After having written about several
  groups of aborigines who inhabit the
  central part of the republic, I wish to
  extend these notes with the aid of documents
  in my possession to the Indians of
  Tabasco and Chiapas.</p>
<p>The customs, habits, and inclinations
  of all those Indians in general do not,
  with any certainty, evoke any hope for
  the improvement of their race and their
  subsequent utility and usefulness to the
  nation. The task I have set for myself
  is a very delicate one, and there may
  exist a great many people who will attribute
  to lack of patriotism the frank statement
  of many defects in our population;
  but I observe that our nation is not moving
  toward its aggrandizement with the
  alacrity and speed which the progressives
  among the authorities wish to see.
  Therefore I consider it necessary to study
  and point out the defects. I do not
  wish it to appear as if the conceptions
  expressed in these lines were imputations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span> of my own imagination, and I wish to
  state, therefore, that whatever is said in
  this report is extracted from official
  documents in my possession.</p>
<p>The aborigines living in the towns and
  villages of the district of Jalpa, and the
  same may be said of the rest of the
  Indians of Tabasco, despite their docility,
  prefer the wild, uncivilized life of the
  mountains to the advantages of communal
  life, if by so doing they are able to
  evade all public responsibilities and duties.
  They come together only for their
  religious festivities, and on all such
  occasions they are given to drunkenness
  and gluttony to such a degree that they
  contract very serious diseases which in a
  great many cases hasten their demise.
  With very few exceptions they live in
  complete vagrancy, and they propagate
  without respecting any degree of blood
  relationship. They insist on curing their
  diseases with all sorts of roots and
  plants, which, however, mostly impair
  their health, causing great mortality,
  especially among children. This may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span> regarded as the principal cause why very
  few among their number reach the age
  of fifty years.</p>
<p>The aborigines who inhabit the borders
  to the river Usumacinta and its tributaries
  are for the greater part natives of
  Yucatan, and are like all the rest of their
  kind, very fond of drinking. The Indians
  of Tenosique, about forty years ago,
  were known as very honest and trustworthy,
  but their intercourse with the
  rebels and emigrants from Yucatan have
  demoralized them to a great extent.</p>
<p>These and other defects, with but a
  few honorable exceptions, are revealed
  in the documents treating of the Indians
  of the district of Comitan, state of
  Chiapas, which, however, I am not going
  to enumerate, so as to avoid repetitions,
  and by so doing make this article altogether
  too long.</p>
<p>All the above mentioned shows the
  decadence and general degeneration of
  the aborigines, as compared with the
  very scant elements of vitality and vigor
  that might help in the movement toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> progress in our republic. The same
  customs, the same reserve and diffidence
  which characterized the Indian of colonial
  days is manifestly still his today under
  the so-called protective laws of the republic,
  which barely give him the title
  of citizen. Yet, as I have stated before,
  I do not belong to those who despair of
  his ultimate civilization, and I believe
  that the most efficacious means of
  effecting this is by crossing his breed or
  race by way of colonization, introducing
  other nations and elements to come in
  contact with him.</p>
<p>That this efficacious means of stopping
  the infinite defects which retard, if they
  do not hinder, the natural progress of our
  nation, has not been attained, to my idea,
  lies in the fact that so far no protective
  laws have existed which, founded on prevision,
  afford guaranties and procure
  work for colonists. There are no laws
  that fix the boundaries of the immense
  stretches of waste-land within our country,
  nor a careful study of climate, geology,
  and production. There is not, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> my knowledge, any report establishing
  the best methods of making all our territory
  productive either through sales or
  the renting of all lands that cannot be
  tilled by their original owners. Our own
  elements, as we have tried to demonstrate
  in this article, are either heterogeneous
  or too scarce and insufficient to
  accomplish the task of carrying the
  nation onward on the road of aggrandizement.
  Hence it is, according to my
  idea, colonization, and colonization alone,
  that may serve as the final remedy for
  our national ills.</p>
<p>If we had today laws such as I have
  had reference to, we would at this very
  moment see European colonists arrive
  continually, attracted by hopes of a
  splendid future which our fertile soil and
  our salubrious climate offer to the industrious
  and enterprising man. Our population
  would increase daily at the same
  pace with the United States of Brazil and
  Buenos Aires, where European immigration
  forms an element of prosperity.</p>
<p>It remains for our government to fix in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span> the most decisive way the answer to this
  question in the interest of the future of
  our country.</p>

<h2><a name="NOTES_ON_THE_SUPERSTITIONS" id="NOTES_ON_THE_SUPERSTITIONS">NOTES ON THE SUPERSTITIONS<br />
  OF THE INDIANS<br />
  OF YUCATAN</a> </h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">Informe contra Idolorvm Cvltores<br />
  del Ob&iacute;spado de Yvcatan.<br />
  Madrid, 1639</span></h3>
<h3><span class="smcap">By Pedro Sanchez de Aguilar</span></h3>
<p>The abuses and superstitions in
  which those Indians of Yucatan
  believe and the abuses
  which they cherish are mostly
  inherited from their forebears, and are as
  numerous as they are varied in kind.
  I am including in this report all I was
  able to investigate, so that they may
  enable the curates to disapprove them
  publicly, and in their sermons to reprimand
  the Indians on account of them.</p>
<p>They believe in dreams which they try
  to interpret to suit the occasion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<p>On hearing the cawing (or cackle) of a
  bird they call <i>kipxosi</i>, they interpret it
  to mean poor success to whatever enterprise
  they are engaged in at the time.
  They consider it as a bad omen or foreboding,
  as the Spaniards do with the
  female fox or the cuckoo.</p>
<p>If, while the Indian is traveling, he
  stumbles over a big stone among a pile
  which had been dug up to build or level a
  road, he venerates it by placing on the
  top of it a little twig, brushing his knees
  with another one in order not to get tired.
  This is a tradition of his forefathers.</p>
<p>If he happens to be traveling near sunset,
  and he fears that he will arrive late
  or even at night at the village he is
  bound for, he will drive a stone into the
  first tree he finds, believing that this will
  retard the setting of the sun. Another
  superstition to the same effect is the
  pulling out of some of his eyelashes and
  blowing them toward the sun. These are
  superstitions that came down to him by
  tradition from his forebears.</p>
<p>During lunar eclipses they still believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span> in the tradition of their forefathers to
  make their dogs howl or cry by pinching
  them either in the body or ears, or else
  they will beat on boards, benches, and
  doors. They say that the moon is dying,
  or that it is being bitten by a certain
  kind of ant which they call <i>xubab</i>. Once,
  while at the village of Yalcob&aacute;, I heard
  great noises during an eclipse of the
  moon which occurred that night, and in
  my sermon the next day I tried to make
  them understand the cause of the eclipse
  in their own language, according to the
  interpretation from the Philosopher:
  &quot;The lunar eclipse is the interposing of
  the earth between the sun and the moon
  with the sun on top and the moon in the
  shadow.&quot; With an orange to represent
  the sphere of Sacrobosco, and two lit
  candles on either side, I explained to
  them plainly and at sight what an eclipse
  really was. They seemed astonished, and
  quite happy and smiling, cured of their
  ignorance and that of their forefathers.
  I gave orders to their chieftain (ca&ccedil;ique)
  that he should punish in the future all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> those who made a noise on such occasions.</p>
<p>They also call certain old Indian
  shamans when a woman is in labor, and,
  with words of their former idolatry, he
  will enchant her and hear her confession.
  They do the same with some other
  patients. I could not find out all about
  this, for which I am very sorry.</p>
<p>There are some Indian medicine-men
  who, with similar enchantment, are supposed
  to cure the bites or stings of snakes,
  especially of the rattlesnakes, of which
  there are a great many here. The victims
  of such bites are sometimes delirious, and
  often the flesh around the wound will
  decay until they die. The remedy the
  wizards give them, according to what I
  heard, is to make them eat human excrement
  or drink the juice of lemons, or
  else they will take a domestic fowl and
  place its beak on the wound, and have it
  suck in this way the poison of the snakebite.
  The hen or chicken will of course
  die, and they immediately replace it by
  another live one, and repeat that until all
  the poison is absorbed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
<p>When they build new houses, which
  occurs every ten or twelve years, they
  will not inhabit nor even enter them
  unless the old wizard has been brought
  even from a distance of one, two, or three
  leagues to bless it or consecrate it with
  his stupid enchantment. This, however,
  I have only heard, and I am now sorry
  never to have recorded it personally.</p>
<p>They are fortune-tellers, and they perform
  this feat with a heap of grained corn,
  counting always two and two grains, and
  if it comes out in even numbers, the
  fortune-teller will continue counting one,
  two, or three times over until it comes out
  uneven, bearing all the while in mind the
  main facts or reason for which he had
  been called on to tell the fortune, <i>vera
  gratia</i>. Once a girl ran away from home,
  and her mother, like any true Indian
  woman would have done in a similar case,
  immediately called one of those fortune-tellers,
  who drew lots on all the different
  roads until the fortune told of or pointed
  to a certain road the girl had taken and
  where she would be found. They sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span> out to look for her and found her in the
  village to which that road led. I punished
  that wizard, who was a native of a
  village at one league from Valladolid,
  and while I examined him with patience
  and slowly, I found that all the words he
  used in that so-called fortune-telling,
  while he counted the grains of corn, were
  no more than &quot;Odd or even, odd or
  even&quot; (<i>huylan nones, caylan pares</i>). He
  could not even tell me whether those
  words were meant as an invocation to
  Satan. In fact, he seemed not to know
  what they meant, for this particular
  wizard was a very great simpleton, almost
  imbecile.</p>
<p>In this city of M&eacute;rida it is publicly
  known that there exist several Indian
  sorceresses (witches), who by using
  certain words can open a rosebud before
  it is time for its opening, which is given
  to the one they wish to attract to their
  lascivious desire. They let him smell of
  it, or they place it under his pillow;
  but should the person who gives it to
  him smell its perfume, she is said invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> to lose her mind for a long while,
  calling to the one she expected to inhale
  it, and in whose name the rose was
  opened by the witch&mdash;a worthy matter
  which serves as medicine as well as
  punishment, especially if it hits the double
  mark. It has also been assured that the
  Indian women of this city are wont to
  throw a certain enchantment into the
  chocolate which is ready for their husbands
  to drink, and by it they become
  bewildered. This I only heard however,
  and I could not vouchsafe its truth.</p>
<p>I will also note here what I saw as a
  child, and that is that they used to drown
  in a hole young puppies of a breed of
  dogs they raise as pets as well as for food.
  These are a kind of dogs, with but little
  or no hair at all, which they call <i>tzomes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It is an old Jewish dogma of <i>cosher</i>. See
  the Apostle, <i>ut abstineant se a suffocatis</i>,
  etc.&mdash;that they abstain from the food of
  animals dying by smothering or any kind
  of natural death.</p>

<h2><a name="OF_THE_RELIGIOUS_BELIEFS" id="OF_THE_RELIGIOUS_BELIEFS">OF THE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS<br />
  OF THE INDIANS OF<br />
  YUCATAN IN 1545</a> </h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">Report of Francisco Hernandez</span></h3>
<p>When our people discovered the
  kingdom of Yucatan they
  found crosses there, and one
  cross in particular which was
  made of stone and mortar, of a height of
  ten palms, and was erected in the center
  of a court or enclosure, very prominent
  and fair, and crowned with battlements;
  it stands alongside of a sumptuous temple
  and is very much frequented by a great
  number of people. This is on the island
  of Cozumel, which lies near the mainland
  of Yucatan. It is said that this cross
  was really adored as the God of Water or
  Rain; as often as there was a drought they
  went to sacrifice quail before it, as will be
  told later. When asked whence or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> through whom they had first heard of
  that sign, they replied that a very handsome
  man had once passed through their
  country and that he left it with them,
  that they might always remember him
  by it. Others, it is said, answered that
  it was because a man more resplendent
  than the sun had died on that cross.
  This is referred to by Peter Martyr in
  chapter I of his Fourth Decade.</p>
<p>I shall refer to another tale or report
  which is very unusual and new regarding
  the Indies, and which until now has not
  been found in any other part of them.
  As this kingdom, on account of its close
  proximity to it, comes within the jurisdiction
  of my bishopric of Chiapa, on
  one of my visits I disembarked and remained
  at a very healthy port. I met
  there a clergyman, good, so it seemed,
  of mature age and honest, and [one] who
  knew the language of the natives from
  having lived there several years. As it
  was necessary for me to return to my
  episcopal residence, I nominated him
  as my vicar, and ordered and entreated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> him to travel inland and visit the Indians
  there and preach to them in a certain
  way in which I instructed him. After a
  certain number of months (I even believe
  it was one year), he wrote to me that on
  his trip he had met a principal lord or
  chief, and that on inquiring of him concerning
  his faith and the ancient belief
  all over his realm, he answered him that
  they knew and believed in God who was
  in heaven; that that God was the
  Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
  That the Father is called by them <i>I&ccedil;ona</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and that he had created man and all
  things. The Son's name was <i>Bacab</i>,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> who was born from a maiden who had
  ever remained a virgin, whose name was <i>Chibirias</i>,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and who is in heaven with
  God. The Holy Ghost they called <i>Echuac</i>.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> They say that <i>I&ccedil;ona</i> means
  the great Father. <i>Bacab</i>, who is the
  son, they say killed <i>Eopuco</i>,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and
  flagellated him, crowning him with a
  crown of thorns, and placed him with
  arms extended on a pole, not meaning
  that he should be nailed to it, but tied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span> (and in order to show him how, the
  chief extended his own arms), where he
  finally died. He was dead for three
  days, but on the third day he returned to
  life and went up to heaven, and he is
  there with his Father. After this immediately
  came <i>Echuac</i>, which is the
  Holy Ghost, and he filled the earth with
  all it needs. When asked what <i>Bacab</i> or <i>Bacabab</i> meant, he said it meant the
  son of the great Father, and that <i>Echuac</i> meant merchant. And very good merchandise
  did the Holy Ghost bring to
  this earth, for he filled men with all their
  faculties, and divine and abundant graces. <i>Chibirias</i> means mother of the Son of
  the great Father. He added, furthermore,
  that at a certain time all men would
  have to die, but he did not seem to know
  anything of the resurrection of the flesh.
  When asked how they came to know all
  these things, the chief replied that the
  lords taught their sons, and in this
  manner it descended from one age to
  another. They also assert that in olden
  times, long ago, there came to the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> twenty men (he gave the names of fifteen
  of them), but because they were very
  poorly written, and furthermore as they
  do not have great importance for this
  report, I do not copy them. Of the five
  others the vicar says he could not obtain
  their names. The principal one was
  called <i>Cocolcan</i>,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and they called this
  one the God of all kinds of fevers. Two
  of the others are the Gods of fish, still
  another two the Gods of farms and
  homesteads [landed properties], still another
  was the God of Lightning, etc.
  They all wore long gowns or mantles,
  and sandals for their feet. They had
  long beards, and wore nothing to cover
  their heads. These men ordained that
  the people should go to confession and
  should fast, and some people fasted on
  Fridays because on that day <i>Bacab</i> had
  died. The name of this day (Friday) is <i>Himis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and they honor it in their devotion
  on account of the death of <i>Bacab</i>.
  The chiefs (ca&ccedil;iques) know all the particulars
  of those things, but the common
  people believe only in the three persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> <i>I&ccedil;ona</i> and <i>Bacab</i> and <i>Echuac</i>, and in <i>Chibirias</i>, the mother of <i>Bacab</i>, and also
  [in] the mother of <i>Chibirias</i> called <i>Hischen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> whom we consider to have been
  Saint Ann. All this above stated is from
  information I have received in a letter
  from that reverend father whose name
  is Francisco Hernandez, and I still have
  his letter among my papers. He also
  stated that he took the said chief to a
  Franciscan friar who lived near there,
  and that the ca&ccedil;ique repeated all he said
  before the friar, and they remained both
  greatly surprised at it. If all those things
  just stated are true, it would seem that
  that part of the land had been (long ago)
  informed about our Holy Faith, for in
  no other part of the Indies have we ever
  found such news. It is true that in
  Brazil, which belongs to the Portuguese,
  it was stated that traces of the wanderings
  of Saint Thomas the Apostle had been
  discovered, but such news could not very
  well fly over through the air, and furthermore
  it is quite certain that the country
  and kingdom of Yucatan give us more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span> special and singular cases to ponder over,
  and of far greater antiquity, if we think
  of the great, exquisite, and admirable
  way the most ancient buildings are constructed,
  also of a certain lettering in
  queer characters which are not found
  anywhere else. Finally these are the
  secrets which only God knows.</p>

    the name applied to hairless dogs. The common
    appellation is <i>k&uacute;kbil</i>, or <i>kikbil</i>. <i>Tzom</i> in Maya
    means a horn, also a proboscis.  The word <i>tzomes</i> is close to <i>tzimin</i>, pl. <i>tzimines</i>, the name
    of the tapir, which has an elongate snout. Alonzo
    Ponc&eacute; who was in Yucatan in 1588, speaks of
    tapirs being called by the natives <i>tzimines</i>, and

    notes 15 to 22 represent, with a single exception,
    in misspelled form, well-known Mayan deities.
    It is interesting to note the early influence of the
    Spaniards on the religious beliefs of the Maya, as
    evidenced by the interpretation given to Father
    Hernandez by the old ca&ccedil;ique.  There is a
    curious mixture of old and new in the account.
    Dr Seler has identified the various deities spoken
    of, and a description of their attributes will be
    found in Brinton's Primer of Mayan Hieroglyphs.
    I&ccedil;ona is <i>Itzamna</i>, chief of the beneficent gods, the
    personification of the East. According to Brinton
    the name means &quot;the dew or moisture of the
    morning.&quot; Brinton writes, &quot;He was said to have
    been the creator of men, animals, and plants,<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span> and was the founder of the culture of the Mayas.
    He was the first priest of their religion, and invented
    writing and books.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
  <p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> According to Brinton the <i>Bacabs</i>, or <i>Chacs</i>,
    were the offspring of <i>Itzamna</i> and his consort <i>Ix-Chel</i> (spoken of by the ca&ccedil;ique as <i>Hischen</i>).</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
  <p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> <i>Chibirias</i> is identified by Seler as <i>Ix-chebel-yax</i>,
    who, according to Brinton, was &quot;the inventress
    of painting and of colored designs on
    woven stuffs.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
  <p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> <i>Echuac</i> is <i>Ek Chua</i>, said by Landa to be
    the god of the cacao planters, hence, as cacao-beans
    were the medium of exchange, the god of
    merchants, as here related.  It is difficult to
    understand the confusion by which this god has
    been interwoven in Christian beliefs as the Holy
    Ghost.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
  <p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> <i>Eopuco</i> has been interpreted by Seler as<i> Ah uoh puc</i>, or <i>Ah-puch</i>, the God of Death, or
    God of Evil. Brinton believes that &quot;these words
    mean the Undoer, or Spoiler, apparently a
    euphemism to avoid pronouncing a name of evil
    omen.&quot; In modern Maya he is plain <i>Yum cimil</i>,
    lord of death.</p>

    same as the Nahuan <i>Quetzalcoatl</i>. <i>Kukulcan</i> was
    the feathered or winged serpent god, a deity of
    culture and kindliness.</p>

    and that the goddess was also known as <i>Ix Kan
    Leom</i>, &quot;the spider-web&quot; which catches the dew
    of the morning. Her children, according to
    Brinton, the <i>Bacabs</i> or <i>Chacs</i> were &quot;four mighty
    brethren, who were the gods of the four cardinal
    points, of the winds which blow from them, of
    the rains these bring, of the thunder and the
    lightning, and consequently of agriculture, the
    harvests, and food supply. Their position in the
    ritual was of the first importance. To each were
    assigned a particular color and a certain year
    and day in the calendar.&quot;</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
